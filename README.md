# Octal_to_Binary
This project aims to take an ASCII string input as an octal number, and convert to a binary number of 16 bits.
sz_Convertor.cpp contains the function that is responsible of checking input validity and digit conversion.
The powerpoint file contains a flowchart and a live demo video.
Thank you.
